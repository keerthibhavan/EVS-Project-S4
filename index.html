								<h3 class="media-heading">Tropical Rain Forest</h3>
								<p>A rain forest is simply an area of tall, mostly evergreen trees and a high amount of rainfall. This dense rain forest is on the island of Borneo, which straddles two oceans (the Indian and the South Pacific) and is shared by three nations (Indonesia, Malaysia, and Brunei).
                   Rainforests are Earth's oldest living ecosystems, with some surviving in their present form for at least 70 million years.

								<h3 class="media-heading">Mediterranean Forest</h3>
								<p>Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub is a biome defined by the World Wide Fund for Nature.
                   The biome is generally characterized by dry summers and rainy winters, although in some areas rainfall may be uniform. Summers are typically hot in low-lying inland locations but can be cool near colder seas. Winters are typically mild to cool in low-lying locations but can be cold in inland and higher locations. 
                  All these ecoregions are highly distinctive, collectively harboring 10% of the Earth's plant species.

								<h3 class="media-heading">Deciduous Forest</h3>
								<p> A deciduous forest is a biome dominated by deciduous trees which lose their leaves seasonally. The Earth has temperate deciduous forests, and tropical and subtropical deciduous forests, also known as dry forests. Another name for these forests is broad-leaf forests because of the wide, flat leaves on the trees.
                   Trees in tropical deciduous forests lose their leaves in the dry season and regrow them in the rainy season. In temperate deciduous forests, trees lose their leaves in the fall and regrow them in the spring.

								<h3 class="media-heading">Drugs</h3>
								<p>Approximately 10% of today’s drugs are derived from tropical medicinal plants, including quinine, curare 
                  and a number of steroids. Around three thousand plants have anti-cancer properties and 70% of these are to 
                  be found in tropical forests.<br><br>
                  The medicinal plants living in wet forests include the Samambaia (Polypodium lepidopteris), 
                  a fern that grows in the rainy forests of South-America and whose therapeutic properties reside 
                  in the rhizome and roots.<br><br>
                   In Amazonia, the Boras people use its leaves to treat cough, while others use the steeped rhizome to treat 
                   fever and root infusions. Traditional Brazilian medicine makes use of
                   Samambaia to treat bronchitis, cough 
                   and other respiratory conditions,
                   while in Peru it is also used to treat infections of the urinary tract and many skin conditions.

								<h3 class="media-heading">Paper Pulp</h3>
								<p>
									Paper pulp is raw material for paper manufacture that contains vegetable, mineral, or man-made fibres. 
									It forms a matted or felted sheet on a screen when moisture is removed.
									<br><br>
									Pulp is a lignocellulosic fibrous material prepared by chemically or mechanically 
									separating cellulose fibers from wood, fiber crops, waste paper, or rags
									<br><br>
									The most abundant source of cellulose is the forest, though trees differ in the value of their fibre for making paper. 
									The fibre of flax, cotton, jute, sisal, manila hemp, and the like usually comes to the paper industry as a secondary 
									product, after serving other uses.
									<br><br>
									Paper, matted or felted sheet, usually made of cellulose fibres, formed on a wire screen from water suspension. 
									A brief treatment of paper follows. Paper has been traced to China in about ad 105.

								<h3 class="media-heading">Wood</h3>
								<p>Wood is by far the most important product harvested from forests. <br><br>
                  The wood is commonly manufactured into paper, lumber, plywood, and other products. 
                  In addition, in most of the forested regions of the less-developed world firewood 
                  is the most important source of energy used for cooking and other purposes. <br><br>
                  Potentially, all of these forest products can be sustainably harvested. 
                  Unfortunately, in most cases forests have been unsustainably overharvested, 
                  resulting in the "mining" of the forest resource and widespread ecological degradation. <br><br>
                  Wood can be used for Home Construction, Fencing , making Utensils, Artworks, Musical instrument, Sports Equipment, Furniture,
                  Shipbuilding, Fuel & Stationary.

              <h2>Facts about Forests</h2>
            </div>
            
            <ol type="1"><br><br>
              <li>Forests are home to over 80 percent of land animals and plants and cover 31 percent of the world’s total land area. About 1.6 billion people around the world depend on forests for their livelihoods and daily subsistence needs.</li><br>
              <li>A tree can sequester up to 150 kilograms of carbon dioxide per year. The world’s forests store an estimated 296 gigatonnes of carbon in both above- and below-ground biomass. Just imagine: Europe’s 400 billion trees currently absorb almost 9 percent of the continent’s greenhouse gas emissions!</li><br>
              <li>Trees are important for creating sustainable cities: in urban areas, they can cool the air by up to 8 degrees, reducing air conditioning needs by 30 percent. Urban trees are also excellent air filters, removing harmful pollutants and fine particulates.</li><br>
              <li>Wood fuel provides 40 percent of today's global renewable energy supply – as much as solar, hydroelectric and wind power combined. Greater investment in technological innovation and in sustainably managed forests is key to increasing forests' role as a renewable energy.</li><br>
              <li>Forest products contribute to reducing and replacing polluting and carbon intensive materials. Certified wood-based fibers (such as Lyocell) used in textile production are very resource efficient. In comparison, cotton requires on average 130 times more water and polyester emits on average 170 times more greenhouse gasses.</li><br>
              <li>Using wood for construction saves about 40 percent of carbon emissions in comparison to concrete, and about 30 percent in comparison to steel. Overall, global carbon dioxide emissions could be reduced by up to 31 percent if builders used wood instead of steel and concrete.</li><br>
              <li>More than 25 percent of the medicines we use originate in rainforest plants. Yet only 1 percent of rainforest plants have been studied for medicinal properties.</li><br>
              <li>More than one third of our biggest cities, including New York, Bogota, Tokyo and Barcelona, get a significant proportion of their high-quality drinking water from protected forests.</li><br>
              <li>The tallest tree in the world is called Hyperion. It’s a coast redwood from California that is an incredible 115.61 metres tall. The largest tree in the world by volume is a giant sequoia called General Sherman which has a trunk 10 metres round and contains an estimated 1486 cubic metres of wood.</li><br>
              <li>A large oak tree can transpire 151,000 litres of water in a year. On average, 40 percent of rainfall over land originates from evapotranspiration from plants. In some areas the amount is even higher. For example, more than 70 percent of rainfall in the Rio de la Plata river basin originates from evapotranspiration from the Amazon forest.</li><br>
